# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail).

Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.
